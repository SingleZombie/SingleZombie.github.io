# RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

## **Text Mining in Education**  (Sep 2020 - present)

*Advisor: Prof. Janet K. Allen, Farrokh Mistree, The University of Oklahoma, US*

* Aim to create a self-tutoring system which offers suggestions to students based on their input learning statements(a learning statement is a formatted triple(experience, learning, value)). The self-tutoring system calculates the semantic similarity between input learning statement and learning statements in database by using SBERT and gets results based on similarity.
* I proposed the idea and developed the program. I learned how to generate ideas that benefit others, implement the ideas through research and show my results to other researchers.
* The abstract of paper has been accepted by ASEE.

## Incident Radiance Field Reconstruction Using Machine Learning (Apr 2020 -Aug 2020)

*Advisor: Prof. Lei Zhang, Beijing Institute of Technology， China*

* Based on a recent well-performed method, the research aims to improve the performance of two neural networks which adaptively reconstruct and sample the radiance of a scene to guide path tracing.

* I was responsible to reproduce the paper and propose new ideas. I learned how to search related papers in a specific area and read papers.
